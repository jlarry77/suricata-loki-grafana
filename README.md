# Homelab Suricata IDS/IPS with Loki & Grafana

This repository details the setup of a network intrusion detection system in a homelab environment using Suricata for threat detection, Promtail for log collection, Loki for log storage, and Grafana for visualization and alerting. All components are deployed on Fedora Server VMs.

## Project Goals

* Deploy Suricata as an IDS sensor.
* Collect Suricata's EVE JSON logs using Promtail.
* Store and query logs efficiently with Grafana Loki.
* Visualize network security events and alerts using Grafana dashboards.
* Demonstrate practical Linux systems administration and network security skills.
